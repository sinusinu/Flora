# Flora
Flora is a .NET 2D game development framework.

## Caution

Flora is still in early development, and nothing is set in stone. If you want to try Flora now, be aware that your application may break at any time. Try it at your own risk.

## About

Flora aims to be a just-enough game dev framework that does the dirty works for you - without too much restriction and over-packed features. It is heavily influenced by [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/), and took a lot of concepts from it.

It is built on .NET 5 and SDL2, so while it could be cross-platform, currently only Windows is considered as a supported platform. With some modification, it will probably run on Linux or macOS, but those platforms are not officially supported for now.

## Documentation

Writing some basics into [Wiki](https://github.com/sinusinu/Flora/wiki) is planned in near future.

Flora's public functions are usually documented with [documentation comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments), so check out the sources if you need more info.
