# Flora
Flora is a .NET 2D game development framework.

## Disclaimer

Flora is currently developed mainly for my personal use. It may lack some important features.

## About

Flora aims to be a just-enough framework that does the dirty works for you - without too much restriction and over-packed features. It is heavily influenced by [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/), and took a lot of concepts from it.

Since it is built on .NET 6 and SDL2, it could be theoretically cross-platform, but currently only Windows is considered as a supported platform. With some modification, it will probably run on Linux or macOS, but those platforms are not officially supported for now.
