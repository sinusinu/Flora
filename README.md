# Flora
Flora is a .NET 2D game development framework.

## Disclaimer
Flora is currently being developed mainly for my personal use, thus it may lack some basic functionalities.

## About
Flora aims to be a minimal, just-enough framework that does the dirty works for you - so you can focus on building core elements of the game.

It is heavily influenced by [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/), and took a lot of concepts from it.

Flora is designed to run on Windows. Since it is built on .NET 6 and SDL2, it could theoretically be cross-platform, but currently only Windows is considered as a supported platform. With some modification, it may run on Linux or macOS, but those platforms are not officially supported for now.
